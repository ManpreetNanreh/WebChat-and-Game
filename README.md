# WebChat-and-Game
A WebApp written using Express Node.js and WebSockets where the user can chat and play a game.

The website allows the user to register an account and create a profile. Once they are registered, the user can chat with fellow players in the chatroom or they can update their profile. The user is able to play the game with the option to provide custom settings. It is an MMO game similar to the one I created in WebWargame-RESTfilAPI. The player are able to join a game world and defeat the monsters with the help of their teammates.

The chatroom is created using WebSockets. The game also uses WebSockets to transfer user data back and forth. The database interaction with the frontend is written using express node.js.
